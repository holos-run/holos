# Setup

This tutorial will guide you through the installation of Holos and its
dependencies, as well as the initialization of a minimal Platform that you can
extend to meet your specific needs.

# Prerequisites

Holos integrates with the following tools that should be installed to enable
their functionality.

* [Helm][helm] to fetch and render Helm chart Components
* [Kubectl][kubectl] to [kustomize][kustomize] components.

# Install Holos

Holos is distributed as a single file executable that can be installed in a couple of ways.

### Releases

Download `holos` from the [releases](https://github.com/holos-run/holos/releases) page and place the executable into your shell path.

### Go install

Alternatively, install directly into your go bin path using:

```shell
go install github.com/holos-run/holos/cmd/holos@latest
```

# Do I need a Kubernetes cluster?

Holos only generates rendered Kubernetes manifests, so you don't need a
Kubernetes cluster to start using the tool or understand its workflow. However,
you will need a cluster eventually to apply the rendered manifests and verify
that they achieve the desired end state.

We recommend using [k3d](https://k3d.io/) to set up a minimal Kubernetes cluster with
[Orbstack](https://docs.orbstack.dev/install) or
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/). To simplify this,
we've created [the Local Cluster guide](../topics/4-local-cluster.mdx) which
automates the process, ensuring proper DNS and TLS certificates, and includes a
script to reset the cluster to a known good state.

When you're ready to experiment with a live Kubernetes cluster, refer to [the
Local Cluster guide](../topics/4-local-cluster.mdx).

# Initialize a new Platform

Use Holos to generate a minimal platform using the recommended directory structure
by creating an empty directory and then using the `holos generate platform` subcommand:

<Tabs groupId="tutorial-setup-generate-platform">
  <TabItem value="command" label="Command">
```bash
mkdir holos_platform
cd holos_platform
holos generate platform v1alpha4
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="output" label="Output">
```txt
no output
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Holos creates a `platform` directory with a `platform.gen.cue` file that serves
as the foundation for your newly initialized Holos Platform. For each Holos
Component you model, you'll add a new CUE file to the platform directory,
mapping it to the location of the Component's CUE code, and extending the
capabilities of your platform.

# Next Steps

Now that you've got Holos and its prerequisites installed, continue on to the
[Hello Holos page](./3-hello-holos.mdx) where we will guide you through the
process of creating your first Component and modeling a Helm chart.
