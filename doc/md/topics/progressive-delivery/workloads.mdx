# Workloads

{/*
Based on my experience with enterprise Kubernetes platforms, "Workloads" or
"Applications" are the two most common terms, with "Workloads" being more
technically precise and common in platform engineering circles.

Here's why:

1. "Workloads" is preferred because:
   - It's the term Kubernetes itself uses (Deployments, StatefulSets etc. are "workload" resources)
   - It encompasses both services and batch jobs
   - It clearly distinguishes from platform infrastructure
   - Major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) use this terminology

2. "Applications" is also common but has some drawbacks:
   - Can be ambiguous whether it means a single service or a group of services
   - Doesn't naturally include batch jobs or data processing
   - More of a business/product term than a technical one

3. Less common terms:
   - "Services" - Too specific, excludes jobs/tasks
   - "Business Applications" - Too wordy
   - "User Applications" - Ambiguous about which users
   - "Customer Workloads" - Implies external customers

Looking at your question about "software my internal teams build for our
business", these are classic workloads - the business logic, services, and jobs
that run on top of the platform you provide.

So while both "Workloads" and "Applications" are acceptable, "Workloads" is the
more precise and commonly used technical term in platform engineering contexts.
