# Progressive Delivery

Holos pairs nicely with [Kargo], offering a holistic way to manage the
configuration of reusable progressive rollout deployment pipelines for Holos
components.

> Kargo is a next-generation continuous delivery and application lifecycle
> orchestration platform for Kubernetes. It builds upon GitOps principles and
> integrates with existing technologies, like Argo CD, to streamline and automate
> the progressive rollout of changes across the many stages of an application's
> lifecycle. ([ref](https://github.com/akuity/kargo#:~:text=Kargo%20is%20a%20next%2Dgeneration,stages%20of%20an%20application's%20lifecycle.))

Two main use cases are addressed within this topic.

1. **Platform Components**:  Platform operators want pull requests automatically
opened when new versions of cluster add-ons are available so they can see
upcoming changes clearly.
2. **Workloads**: Product development teams want a well defined deployment
pipeline to automatically and safely promote new features and bug fixes.  For
example, from dev to test to staging, then across multiple production regions
globally.

:::tip
Holos pairs well with Kargo to progressively deploy changes across multiple
clusters.  Contact us for personalized [support] for your use case.
