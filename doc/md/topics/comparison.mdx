# Holos compared to other tools

## Timoni

Holos and Timoni both aim to solve similar problems but approach them at
different levels of the stack.

Timoni focuses on managing applications by evaluating [CUE] stored in OCI
containers. Its creator, Stephan Prodan, envisions a controller that applies the
resulting manifests. In this process, Timoni defers to [Flux] for managing Helm
charts within the cluster.

In contrast, Holos implements the [Rendered Manifests Pattern] and takes a
different approach, particularly in how it handles [Helm] charts. Like
[ArgoCD], Holos renders Helm charts into manifests using the `helm template`
command in its rendering pipeline. Holos differs from Timoni in several important
ways:

1. **Separation of Responsibilities:**  Holos stops short of applying
rendered manifests to a cluster, leaving that task to existing tools like
[ArgoCD], [Flux], or even basic `kubectl apply` commands.

2. **Ecosystem Integration:**  By focusing solely on rendering Kubernetes
manifests, Holos creates space for other tools to handle deployment and
management. For instance, Holos integrates seamlessly with [Kargo] for
progressive rollouts, as [Kargo] operates between Holos and the Kubernetes API.
This approach ensures that you're not locked into any specific tool and can
choose the best solution for each task.

3. **Platform Integration:** Holos focuses on integrating multiple Components
into a larger Platform. In Holos terminology, a Component refers to a wrapper
for [Helm] charts, [Kustomize] bases, or raw YAML files, integrated into the
rendering pipeline through [CUE].  A Platform represents the full combination of
these components.

4. **Explicit Rendering Pipeline:** Holos emphasizes flexibility in its
rendering pipeline. The system allows any tool that generates Kubernetes
manifests to be wrapped in a Generator, which can then feed into existing
transformers like [Kustomize]. This explicit separation makes Holos highly
adaptable for different workflows.
