# Quickstart

Welcome to the Holos Quickstart guide.  Holos is an open source tool to manage
software development platforms safely, easily, and consistently.  We'll use
Holos to manage a fictional bank's platform, the Bank of Holos.  In doing so
we'll take the time to explain the foundational concepts of Holos.

 1. **Platform** - Holos breaks a Platform down into Components owned by teams.
 2. **Component** - Components are CUE wrappers around unmodified upstream
 vendor Helm Charts, Kustomize Bases, or plain Kubernetes manifests.
 3. **CUE** - We write CUE to configure the platform.  We'll cover the basics of
 CUE syntax and why Holos uses CUE.
 4. **Tree Unification** - CUE files are organized into a unified filesystem
 tree.  We'll cover how unification makes it easier and safer for multiple teams
 to change the platform.

The Bank of Holos provides a good example of how Holos is designed to make it
easier for multiple teams to deliver services on a platform.  These teams are:

- **Platform**
- **Software development**
- **Security**
- **Quality Assurance**

In this guide we'll show how Holos enables teams to work autonomously
while still allowing the platform team to enforce the standards and policies
they care about to provide a secure and consistent software development platform.

Here's a screenshot of the retail banking application we'll build and deploy on
our platform.  We'll keep each of these teams in mind as we work through the
guides.  Each of our guides focuses on different aspects of delivering the Bank
of Holos.

## What you'll need {#requirements}

This guide is intended to be informative without needing to run the commands.
If you'd like to render the platform and apply the manifests to a real Cluster,
complete the [Local Cluster Guide](/docs/guides/local-cluster) before this
guide.

You'll need the following tools installed to run the commands in this guide.

1. [holos](/docs/install) - to build the Platform.
2. [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - to render Holos Components that
wrap Helm charts.
3. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - to render Holos
Components that render with Kustomize.

## Install Holos

Start by installing the `holos` command line tool with the following command.
If you don't have Go, refer to [Installation](/docs/install/) to download the
executable.

<Tabs groupId="go-install">
  <TabItem value="command" label="Command">
```bash
go install github.com/holos-run/holos/cmd/holos@latest
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="output" label="Output">
```txt
go: downloading github.com/holos-run/holos v0.97.2
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
Nearly all day-to-day platform management tasks use the `holos` command line
tool to render plain Kubernetes manifests.

## Fork the Git Repository

Building a software development platform from scratch takes time so we've
published an example for our guides.  [Fork the Bank of
Holos](https://github.com/holos-run/bank-of-holos/fork) to get started.

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Run the rest of the commands in this guide from the root of the repository.

## Configuring GitOps {#configuring-gitops}

The Bank of Holos platform is organized as a collection of software components.
Each component represents a piece of software provided by an upstream vendor,
for example ArgoCD, or software developed in-house.  Components are also used to
glue together, or integrate, other components into the platform.

The platform team provides ArgoCD as a means for teams to implement GitOps
within their software development workflow.  Each team using the Bank of Holos
platform uses a Holos resource provided by the platform team to create their
ArgoCD Application definition.  In doing so, the platform team has provided
a "golden path" for each team to independently make the changes they need
while still centrally enforcing the policies that provide a consistent and
safe experience.

Currently each team is using the upstream `bank-of-repo` repository as their
source of truth. We'll start by changing ArgoCD to point to our fork.  This will
allow us to be able to see the results of our changes in ArgoCD using a GitOps
workflow.

We need to render the platform manifests after we make changes.

## Render the Platform

Platform rendering is is the process of looping over all the components in the
platform and rendering each one into plain kubernetes manifest files.  Holos is
designed to write plain manifest files which can be applied to Kubernetes, but
stops short of applying them so it's easier for team members to review and
understand changes before they're made.

## Platform Rendering Explained

So what happens when we run `holos render platform`?  We saw `holos` write plain
manifest files, let's dive into how and why we implemented platform rendering
like this.

### Why do we render the platform? {#why-render-the-platform}

We built Holos to make the process of managing a platform safer, easier, and
more consistent.  Before Holos we used Helm, Kustomize, and scripts to glue
together all of the software that goes into a platform.  Then we coaxed the
output of each tool into something that works with GitOps.  This approach has a
number of shortcomings.  We wanted to see the manifests before ArgoCD or Flux
applied them, so we wrote a lot of difficult to maintain scripts to get the
template output into something useful.  We tried avoiding the scripts by having
ArgoCD handle the Helm charts directly, but we could no longer see the changes
clearly during code review.

The platform rendering process allows us to have it both ways.  We avoid the
unsafe text templates and glue scripts by using CUE.  We're able to review the
exact changes that _will be_ applied during code review because holos renders
the whole platform to plain manifest files.

Finally, because we usually make each change by rendering the whole platform,
we're able to see and consider how a single-line change, like the one we just
made, affects the whole platform.  Before we made Holos we were frustrated with
how difficult it was to get this zoomed-out, broad perspective of each change we
made.

:::tip
Holos implements the [rendered manifests pattern] so you don't have to build it
yourself.
:::

### How does platform rendering work? {#how-platform-rendering-works}

Holos is declarative. CUE provides resources that declare what `holos` needs to
do.  The output of `holos` is always the same for the same inputs, so `holos` is
also idempotent.

When we run `holos render platform`, CUE builds the Platform specification
(spec).  This is a fancy way of saying a list of software to manage on each
cluster in the platform.  The CUE files in the `platform` directory provide the
platform spec to `holos`.

Let's open up two of these CUE files to see how this works.  Ignore the other
files for now, they behave the same as these two.

<Tabs groupId="6F01F2F7-C101-4212-A844-0E370B836B54">

	for Cluster in Fleet.clusters {
		_Platform: Components: "\(Cluster.name):argocd-crds": {
			name:      "argocd-crds"
			component: "projects/platform/components/argocd/crds"
			cluster:   Cluster.name
		}
		_Platform: Components: "\(Cluster.name):argocd": {
			name:      "argocd"
			component: "projects/platform/components/argocd/argocd"
			cluster:   Cluster.name
		}
	}
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="external-secrets" label="platform/external-secrets.cue">
```cue showLineNumbers
package holos

// Manage the component on every cluster in the platform
for Fleet in _Fleets {
	for Cluster in Fleet.clusters {
		_Platform: Components: "\(Cluster.name):external-secrets-crds": {
			name:      "external-secrets-crds"
			component: "projects/platform/components/external-secrets-crds"

		}

			component: "projects/platform/components/external-secrets"
			cluster:   Cluster.name
		}
	}
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

There's quite a few new concepts to unpack in these two CUE files.

1. A Fleet is just a collection of clusters that share a similar, but not
identical configuration.  Most platforms have a management fleet with one
cluster to manage the platform, and a workload fleet for clusters that host the
services we deploy onto the platform.
2. A Cluster is a Kubernetes cluster.  Each component is rendered to plain
manifests for a cluster.

:::important
On lines 6 and 11 we see a Component being assigned to the Platform.  We also
start to dive into the syntax of CUE, which we need to understand a little
before going further.
:::

> In its simplest form, CUE looks a lot like JSON. This is because CUE is a
superset of JSON.  Or, put differently: all valid JSON is CUE.[^1]
>
> 1. C-style comments are allowed
> 2. field names without special characters don't need to be quoted
> 3. commas after a field are optional (and are usually omitted)
> 4. commas after the final element of a list are allowed
> 5. **the outermost curly braces in a CUE file are optional**
>
> JSON objects are called structs in CUE. JSON arrays are called lists, Object
members are called fields, which link their name, or label, to a value.

There are two important things to know about CUE to understand these two files.
First, the curly braces have been omitted which is item 5 on the list above.
Second, CUE is about _unification_.

:::important
Unlike most other languages, it is common to declare the same field in multiple
places.  CUE **unifies** the value of the field.  We can think of CUE as a
Configuration Unification Engine.
:::

Now that we know curly braces can be omitted and values are unified, we can
understand how the rest of the CUE files in the platform directory behave.

:::tip
Each CUE file in the platform directory adds components to the
`_Platform.Components` struct.
:::

The final file in the directory is responsible for producing the Platform spec.
It looks like this.

:::tip
You don't normally need to execute `cue`, CUE is built into `holos`.  We use it
here to gain insight.
:::

We see the platform spec is essentially a list of components, each assigned to a
cluster.

:::important
Notice CUE unifies `Components` from multiple files into one list.

We'll see this unification behavior again and again.  Unification is the
defining characteristic of CUE that makes it a unique, powerful, and _safe_
configuration language.
:::

Holos takes this list of components and builds each one by executing the following command.

```bash
holos render component --cluster-name="example" "path/to/the/component"
```

We can think of platform rendering as rendering a list of components, passing
the cluster name each time.  Rendering each component writes the fully rendered
manifest for that component to the `deploy/` directory, organized by cluster for
GitOps.

## Render a Component

Rendering a component works much the same way as rendering a platform. `holos`
uses CUE to produce a specification, then processes it.  The specification of a
component is called a BuildPlan.  A BuildPlan is a list of zero or more
kubernetes resources, Helm charts, Kustomize bases, and additional files to
write into the `deploy/` directory.

Now let's look at the cert-manager component.  Notice the
`platform/cert-manager.cue` file has the field `path:
"projects/platform/components/cert-manager"`.  This path indicates where to
start working with the cert-manager component.

This file introduces a few new concepts.

1. Line 4 indicates this component produces a BuildPlan that wraps a Helm Chart.
2. Notice `_HelmChart` is referenced on line 4 before it's defined on line 6.
**Order is irrelevant in CUE**.  Complex changes are simpler and easier when we
don't have to think about order.
3. Line 8 and 11: The chart version and namespace are defined in a different
file closer to the root, `projects/cert-manager.cue`
4. Line 19: Helm values are defined in CUE to take advantage of strong type
checking and manage multiple Helm charts consistently with the same values.

Let's take a look at the BuildPlan that results from the CUE configuration
described above.

:::important
Again, you don't normally need to execute `cue`, it's built into `holos`.  We
use it here to show how Holos works with Helm.
:::

Looking at the BuildPlan, we see `holos` will render the Helm chart into the
deploy directory along with an ArgoCD Application resource in the `gitops/`
directory.

:::tip
The BuildPlan API is flexible enough to write any file into the `deploy/`
directory.  Holos uses this flexibility to support both Flux and ArgoCD.
:::

When we run `cue export`, we get back a [Core API] BuildPlan.  The BuildPlan is
produced by the `#Helm` definition on line 4 which is part of the [Author API].
The Core API is the contract between CUE and `holos`.  As such, it's not as
friendly as the Author API.  The Author API is the contract component authors
and platform engineers use to configure and manage the platform.  The Author API
is meant for people, the Core API is meant for machines.  This explains why we
see quite a few fields in the exported BuildPlan we didn't cover in this guide.
Day to day we don't need to be concerned with those fields because the Author
API handles them for us.

:::tip
Our intent is to provide an ergonomic way to manage the platform with the Author
API.
:::

When the Author API doesn't offer a path forward, authors may use the Core API
directly from CUE.  We can think of the Core API as an escape hatch for the
Author API.  We'll see some examples of this in action in the more advanced
guides.

## Review

Let's review the concepts we've covered in this guide:

- A Holos platform is comprised of the CUE files that define the platform specification within the `platform` directory.
- The files in the `platform` directory each model an individual Holos component, and provide the path to the directory where the component's CUE configuration resides.
- A Holos platform must be rendered to generate Kubernetes manifest files.
- Holos resources enable teams to work autonomously while still allowing for centralized enforcement of company policies.
- Changes to one component can impact other components, and we can use `holos render platform` with `git diff` to assess the impact.

## Next Steps

Thank you for finishing the Quickstart guide.  Dive deeper with the next guide
on how to [Deploy a Service] which explains how to take one of your existing
Helm charts or Deployments and manage it with Holos.
