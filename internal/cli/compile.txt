Reads a stream of JSON-encoded Component objects from standard input.  For each
Component, builds a CUE instance then exports a BuildPlan.  Each resulting
BuildPlan is written as a JSON-encoded object to standard output.

This command encapsulates cue export for concurrent use. It may be used directly
by piping the output of holos show platform through jq to select the components
list, then to stdin of this command.  This command is most often invoked 'holos
render platform' to run concurrent cue exports safely.

For example:

  holos show platform --format=json \
    | jq '.spec.components[] | {kind: "Component", apiVersion: "v1alpha6", component: .}' \
    | holos compile --log-level=debug

Note each platform components element is embedded into the component field of an
enveloping object for the purpose of conveying type metadata.
